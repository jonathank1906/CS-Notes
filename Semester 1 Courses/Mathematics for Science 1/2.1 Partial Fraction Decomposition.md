# Special Cases
## Irreducible Quadratic (Order 2) Factor
 **Irreducible quadratic factor:** When a root does not exist. This can also be verified by computing the discriminant, which is 4-AC. If this value is negative then we know that it does not have any roots.




An irreducible quadratic factor is represented by two variables in the numerator. We can identify this because the degree is 2. A normal term would look like (x+9).
$$
\frac{3x+1}{x^2(x^2+9)}=\frac{A}{x}+\frac{B}{x^2}+\frac{Cx+D}{x^2+9}
$$

## Repeated Linear Factor 
When we have a repeated linear factor we have to 

**Repeated linear factor**. Two repeated zeros at 0.
$$
x^2=(x-0)^2
$$
Here is another example with a repeated linear factor:
$$
\frac{2x-4}{(x+1)^2(x-3)}=\frac{A}{x+1}+\frac{B}{(x+1)^2}+\frac{C}{x-3}
$$

# Ideal Case
Procedure:
1. Start by factoring the polynomial in the denominator into linear factors (x terms are of order 1).
2. 


$$
\frac{3x}{x^2+x-2}=\frac{3x}{(x-1)(x+2)}=\frac{A}{x-1}+\frac{B}{x+2}
$$

# Cover-Up Rule
- The cover-up rule can only be used when there are linear factors in the denominator. There cannot be repeated or irreducible quadratic factors.
