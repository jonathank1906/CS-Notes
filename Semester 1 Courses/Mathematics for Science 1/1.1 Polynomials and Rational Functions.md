Polynomial long division and synthetic division are useful for:
- simplifying a polynomial expression.
- finding factors or roots of polynomials, solving polynomial equations, or simplifying rational expressions.

Finding Zeros of Polynomials
1. Predict the number of zeros based on the degree of the polynomial.
2. Graph the polynomial using a calculator and check/note all rational zeros (x-intercepts) as well as multiplicities (cross vs. touch). For non-integer intercepts, check for possibilities using the Rational Root Theorem.
3. IF zeros are unaccounted for, use synthetic division to divide out known factors (created from the zeros in step 3).
4. Use algebra skills (factoring, quadratic formula, etc.) to find any additional zeros.


<font color="#92d050">Polynomial Remainder Theorem:</font> If a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-k)$, then the remainder is $r=f(k)$. 

<font color="#92d050">Polynomial Factor Theorem:</font> A polynomial function $f(x)$ has a factor $(x-k)$ if and only if $f(k)=0$. In other words, itâ€™s only a factor if you can divide it out and get a remainder of zero.

<font color="#92d050">Rational Zeros Theorem:</font> An algorithm for finding a list of all possible rational zeros of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Useful when finding all zeros of a long polynomial.
1. Make a list of all integer factors of the constant (last term). This is the p list. (If there is no constant, factor out powers of x until there is.)
2. make a list of all integer factors of the lead coefficient. This is the q list.
3. Make a list of all reduced factions $\frac{p}{q}$ (both + and - versions). This is the list of all possible rational zeros. 
- This gives us a list of potential rational zeros. However, not every zero will be in this list as it does not include roots such as $\sqrt{3}$, which is not rational, it is an irrational number.
# Polynomial Long Division



# Synthetic Division
Synthetic division is a quicker way to get the same result compared to long division.

> [!QUESTION] When can synthetic division be used?
> Synthetic division can <u>only</u> be used when the divisor is a binomial of the form: (x-c), otherwise we will need to use the long division method.

Procedure:
1. Write the root in the box to the left.
2. Write the coefficients of the dividend to the right of the box. Make sure all terms are included. If there is a term in between missing write a 0 for that term.
3. Leave space underneath the coefficients and draw a horizontal line.
4. Multiply
5. Add
- The rightmost number below the line is the remainder.
- The other numbers below the line are the coefficients of the quotient in order by the degree of the term.



Irrational or complex roots can appear when finding the roots of a factor that cannot be factored more.

# Checking if Factorization is Correct

In order to check if the polynomial long division or synthetic division led to the correct result, use the division algorithm:<u></u>
