# What is OOP?
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm used in software development to model and organize code around real-world entities and their interactions.
- At the core of OOP are the concepts of <u>classes</u> and <u>objects</u>.
- When we combine objects of different classes with different useful techniques like encapsulation, abstraction, etc. to create a end value product; it is known as the OOP technique.
# How OOP Represents the Real-World as Objects
- OOP is a way of writing programs that lets us represent <u>real world things</u> or <u>abstract ideas</u> as **objects**.
	- Objects can be physical items like a banana a microwave oven or even something more abstract like a bank account or library system.
		- Physical objects have properties(attributes) as well as behaviors(methods). 
			- Properties describe the object, such as the title of a book or the size of a window.
			- Behaviors refer to what the object can do or how we can interact with it. For example a book can be read and the window can be opened.
- If we are modeling a chair for example, our goal is to describe what any chair could be like. In this way it makes it possible to identify different types of chairs.

## Why do we use OOP?
- In the real-world there is not a whole lot of things that can be represented by only strings or numbers.
- A class is basically a way that we can <u>define our own custom data type</u>. There is a lot of stuff that cannot be represented by only the basic data types like string or int just by themselves.



# Difference between a Class and an Object
Here’s a breakdown:
- <u>Classes</u> define attributes (properties or fields) and behaviors (methods or functions) in a blueprint form. A class itself doesn’t contain actual values for attributes—rather, it describes what attributes and behaviors instances (objects) of that class will have.
- <u>Objects</u>, or instances of a class, contain actual values for those attributes and can exhibit behaviors defined in the class. When an object is created, it uses the blueprint of the class to hold real data in its attributes and can perform actions (behaviors) as methods are called.

More comparison:
- A class is a collection of variables and functions, all wrapped up into one.


# Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming
- Until now we have been doing something called procedural programming. This means that programs are built around the idea in which they follow a sequence of instructions.
- With OOP we are able to create our very own data types.
- An example of an object in OOP could be car. If you think of a car, it can be considered as an object and it is composed of many parts. For example, it has an entire, a transmission, wheels, and an interior.
- So far you have been creating procedural programs. So what is a procedural program? In procedural programming you create variables using the basic data types and these variable are then manipulated by functions. 
	- Let’s suppose that you want to keep track of all of the classes you are taking at BHS. More precisely you want to keep track of all your assignments, quizzes, and tests. Now let’s suppose that you want to get the averages for your homework, in class assignments, quizzes, and tests. You then want to calculate the weights for each category in order to determine the grade you have. Using procedural programming you would probably create many variables including arrays to store multiple subjects, and assignments. You would then have to create functions in which you can pass in the grades you received for the different assignments. The function would then add up all the scores, divide the sum by how the amount of assignments you have completed and then return the average. By using this approach your program would become large and difficult to maintain.
- Now let’s take a look at Object Oriented Programming: With OOP you can recreate the program above by creating an object (an object of type student). If you sit down and think of your surroundings you will find out that an object is composed of several parts. In our example we can think of the object as a Gradebook. A gradebook has different categories such as:
1. Homework
2. In class assignments
3. Quizzes
4. Tests
- Each category in turn has a point value whether it is a homework assignment or a test. By grouping all of these categories into one we can create variables and member functions that can set, get, and manipulate the information as one object.
