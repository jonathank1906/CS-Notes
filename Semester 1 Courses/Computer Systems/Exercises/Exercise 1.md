### What are 8-bit microcomputers?
- 8-bit microcomputers are a type of computer which uses an 8-bit microprocessor. This allows for a maximum possible values of 256 (values ranging 0 to 255).
- Size of registers is 8-bit

### What were the most popular 8-bit processors?
- MOS Technology 6502
- Zilog Z80



### Find few examples of 8-bit microcomputers
- Commodore 64
- Apple II
- Atari 800


### What limitations did the microcomputers have?
Limited Processing Power: They could only process 8 bits of data at a time, which restricted their ability to handle complex calculations and large data sets efficiently1.

Memory Constraints: These systems typically had limited memory, often only a few kilobytes, which restricted the size and complexity of programs that could be run.

Simple Graphics and Sound: The graphics and sound capabilities were quite basic, which limited the quality of multimedia applications and games.

Slower Performance: Due to their limited processing power and memory, 8-bit microcomputers were relatively slow, especially when performing tasks that required significant computational resources.

Limited Multitasking: These systems were generally not capable of true multitasking, meaning they could only run one program at a time.

Basic User Interfaces: The user interfaces were often text-based and less intuitive compared to modern graphical user interfaces.





### What was cartridge used for in 8-bit microcomputers?
- Cartridges were used for distributing software.

### How were games coded back then?
- Assembly

### What is the assembly language?


### Could we use Python to program 8-bit microcomputers?
- No, python is not compatible
