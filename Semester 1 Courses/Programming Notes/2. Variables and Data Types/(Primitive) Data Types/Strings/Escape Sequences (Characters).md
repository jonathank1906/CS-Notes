- Escape sequences tell the compiler to treat characters in a special way. '\\' is called the escape character.
- To create a newline in output use `\n` or the alternative `cout << endl;`
- They can be placed anywhere in a string.

There are certain characters that have special meaning in C++. For instance, a pair of double quotes represents a string “string” and a pair of single quotes represents a character ‘A’. A problem arises when you try to display a single or double quote or other special character to the console. C++ solves this problem with special character escape sequences.



Take a look at the chart below (same for c# and c++):

| Escape Character Code | Represents<br>  |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| \\b                   | Backspace       |
| \\f                   | Form Feed       |
| \\n                   | Newline         |
| \\r                   | Carriage Return |
| \\t                   | Horizontal Tab  |
| \\"                   | Double Quote    |
| \\'                   | Single Quote    |
| \\\\                  | Backslash       |
| \\v                   | Vertical Tab    |
| \\a                   | Alert           |
| \\?                   | Question        |
