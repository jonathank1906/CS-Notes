- We may exit a loop before it ends.
	- If the loop checks for invalid input that would ruin a calculations, it is often best to end the loop.
- The break-statement can be used to exit a loop before normal termination.
	- Be careful with nested loops! Using break only exits the loop in which the break-statement occurs.
