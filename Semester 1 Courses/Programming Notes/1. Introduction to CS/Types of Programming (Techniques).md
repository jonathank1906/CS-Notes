All programs can be created by using the following three basic structures:
1. Procedural (also called sequence). This is when our code executes from top to bottom, or in other words, one statement after another. These type of programs are not very smart or useful as they are not able to make any decisions.
2. Decision (also called selection). This is where we are able to control the flow of our program by using for example if statements. At this point, our programs appear to be a bit smarter because they have the ability to make decisions.
3. Repetition (also called looping)



# Top-Down Design
- Computer programming is about problem solving.
- The problem you are trying to solve can be complex, therefore it is always better to divide the problem into subproblems. It will be easier to implement the subproblems and if the subproblems are still difficult then we can sub divide it into subproblems. We can keep on doing this subdivision until the problem is simple to solve. 
- We will then start solving the subproblems and working our way to the original problem.
In other words:
- The "art" of computer programming using the top-down approach consists in:
	- Finding a good decomposition of a problem into subproblems.
		- Subproblems can be decomposed further into smaller subproblems.
		- You keep decomposing until subproblems are small enough that could be implemented as functions.
- Subproblems will be implemented as functions in C++.

- Breaking a problem into subproblems or functions, has many advantages, it makes programs easier to:
	- understand
	- change
	- write
	- test
	- debug
	- for teams to develop
