```csharp {cmd}
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}
```
- Line 7 contains the main method, which acts as the entry point for our code.
- The pair of curly braces (lines 8 and 10) is called the body of the main method.
- Notice that semicolons are necessary for statements (line 9).


# Creating the Header (Directives)
- C/C++ programs have directives and statements. Directives are not instructions, but special commands that will be processed by a special program called the preprocessor.

We can conveniently copy and paste the same header code to other programs to save time.
```CS file:"Common Headers/Directives"
using System
```

`int i = 0`


# Namespaces




# Creating the Main Function
- The body is enclosed with curly braces.
# Statements
- Statements are instructions written in C++ that will be executed by the processor after being converting to machine code by the compiler.











# Comments
Comments in C# work the same way as they do in C++.
Developers tend to use `//` for short, one-line comments and `/* */` for anything longer.
