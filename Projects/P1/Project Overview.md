Portfolio = report


Iteration #1: The first iteration aims to create a core version of your product with a text-based user interface (Command Line Interface) and to produce an initial limited draft of the project report. This iteration finishes after we do the mid-term seminar.

Iteration #2: The text-based user interface should be designed so that it can be replaced with more functions, objects, etc. 

The results from iterations #1 and #2 should be included in the following sections:(Requirements, Design, 
Implementation, and Evaluation)
