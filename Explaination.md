- In programming we always need the ability to change the behavior of the program.
- Conditional statements allow us to change the execution order of a program.


# Infinite Loops
- The loop body should contain a statement that will eventually cause the boolean expression to become false.



# Which Loop to Use?
- While-loops are used when there might be occasions when the loop should not run.
- Do-while loops are used when the loop must always run at least once.
- For loops are used when a fixed number iterations, which we know beforehand, should run.

# Ending a Loop
- There are 3 common methods to terminate a loop:
	- List headed by size.
		- When we can determine the size of the list beforehand.
	- Ask before iterating.
		- Ask if the user wants to continue before each iteration.
	- List ended with a sentinel value.
		- Using a particular value to signal the end of the list.
