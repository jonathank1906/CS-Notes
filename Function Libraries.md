- We should use functions from libraries as much as possible.
- To use the predefined functions found in libraries we must "include" them with the include directive.
- For example, to include the `cmath` library that contains `sqrt()` we use: `#include <cmath>`.
- Some standard libraries, such as `cmath`, also require to use the directive `using namespace std;`.
