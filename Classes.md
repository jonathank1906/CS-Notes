# What is a Class?
- In C#, classes are used to create <u>custom types</u>.
- A class serves as a <u>blueprint</u> or <u>template</u> for creating objects. A class represents a category or type of object, like how Ball might represent all kinds of balls in general.
	- It defines the structure and behavior of objects, but at the same time it doesn't represent any specific object.
- You can think of a class as categories; everything in a class is similar in nature and structure. 
 - The selection process of the attributes and behaviors makes sure that the class accurately represents the real-world entity it models. 

# How to Create a Class
