- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard for creating web pages.


# HTML Forms


# Semantic Elements
Semantic HTML elements: these elements clearly describe their purpose and the type of content they contain.

# Non-Semantic Elements
Non-semantic (normal) HTML elements: These elements donâ€™t provide any meaning about the content they wrap. They are generic containers.
