A class contains attributes and behaviors.
A class is a blueprint.


# Namespaces
- Namespaces can be created in two different ways:
1. Block level namespaces. The namespace is given by a pair of curly braces and what is inside them is defined by the namespace. This way is less modern and not preferred compared to file scoped namespaces.
2. File scoped namespaces. These apply to everything in that particular file. The only difference in terms of syntax is the removal of the curly braces and a semicolon at the end of the namespace.


What are the uses of namespaces?
1. Imagine we have two classes with the same name in a project. If we donâ€™t separate these two classes in their own namespace then there will be an error. We cant have two classes with the same name in the same namespace. 
- We are allowed to have multiple namespaces in a single .cs file.

The ? mark always goes in front of the data type or the object type.
