# What is OOP?
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm used in software development to model and organize code around real-world entities and their interactions.
- At the core of OOP are the concepts of <u>classes</u> and <u>objects</u>.
- When we combine objects of different classes with different useful techniques like encapsulation, abstraction, etc. to create a end value product; it is known as the OOP technique.
# How OOP Represents the Real-World as Objects
- OOP is a way of writing programs that lets us represent <u>real world things</u> or <u>abstract ideas</u> as **objects**.
	- Objects can be physical items like a banana a microwave oven or even something more abstract like a bank account or library system.
		- Physical objects have properties(attributes) as well as behaviors(methods). 
			- Properties describe the object, such as the title of a book or the size of a window.
			- Behaviors refer to what the object can do or how we can interact with it. For example a book can be read and the window can be opened.
- If we are modeling a chair for example, our goal is to describe what any chair could be like. In this way it makes it possible to identify different types of chairs.

## Why do we use OOP?
- In the real-world there is not a whole lot of things that can be represented by only strings or numbers.
- A class is basically a way that we can <u>define our own custom data type</u>. There is a lot of stuff that cannot be represented by only the basic data types like string or int just by themselves.



# Difference between a Class and an Object
Here’s a breakdown:
- <u>Classes</u> define attributes (properties or fields) and behaviors (methods or functions) in a blueprint form. A class itself doesn’t contain actual values for attributes—rather, it describes what attributes and behaviors instances (objects) of that class will have.
- <u>Objects</u>, or instances of a class, contain actual values for those attributes and can exhibit behaviors defined in the class. When an object is created, it uses the blueprint of the class to hold real data in its attributes and can perform actions (behaviors) as methods are called.

More comparison:
- A class is a collection of variables and functions, all wrapped up into one.
